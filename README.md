# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

For this project we were required to build a website that displays the weather in a city and it's 5 day forecast. This project was created so that users could type in a city and recieve feedback on the current weather including tempature, humidity, and wind. The UV index will also display for the current day. I learned how to work with bootstrap that makes styling a page easier. I also learned about API's and how to read their documentain and also how to fetch the data and display it on my page.

## Installation

Bootstrap is uded to create the display that a user will see when directed to my page. Bootstrap elements include a jumbotron to diplay my title. A button in order to search cities. And multiple cards to display future forecasts. Open weather Map https://openweathermap.org/api is used as an API that stores the weather data for me. Finally local storage is used to save past searched cities.
